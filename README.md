This project is made using StyleCLIP a project that can be found here: https://github.com/orpatashnik/StyleCLIP
and this version as well: e4e + StyleCLIP w/ global colab (latest fix by [JustinJohn](https://github.com/justinjohn0306)):

This project allows you to automate the image editing AI to generate 1000's of images for any kind of use.

First by normalizing any input (including randomly generated by the script) people to a "blank slate".
